# Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

## A. Methodology and scope

### 1. SA/SD

The present tool allows to create diagrams following the "Structured
Analysis / Stuctured Design" (SA/SD) modelling technique as described
by Edward Yourdon.

SA/RT (which is SA/SD with a real-time extension), can be found in the
design of real-time and embedded systems.
Example: [Firmware modelling of the Active Descent
System](https://www.spyr.ch/ps/ads/qm/node18.html) of the [Rosetta
Lander](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_(spacecraft)>)
spacecraft.

#### a. Context diagram

A Context Diagram can be generated by a special mode (`style context`).

#### b. Data dictionary

Currently there is no explicit way of creating a Data Dictionary.

However, a sort of Data Dictionary can be created by declaring all
relevant items (in particular, `store` items) in a distinct section (file
or snippet) that can be later included in any diagram.

#### c. DFD diagrams

Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) are the main focus of the present tool.

### 2. SA/RT

SA/RT is an extension of SA/SD for real time.

The "Real Time" (the "RT" of "SA/RT") aspect is supported by
`signal` and `control` elements.

Surprisingly, SA/RT is also well-suited to the analyse and design of
web and micro-services architectures.

### 3. Other diagrams (out of scope)

Other diagrams notably used in system analysis and design, including:

- State Transition Diagram (STD)
- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
- Data Structure Diagram (DSD)

are out of scope of the present tool.

## B. Syntax

DFD source files consist of a list of statements, one per line:

```
# Line beginning with "#" are comments.
# Empty lines are allowed.

DFD_STATEMENT
DFD_STATEMENT
...
```

### 1. Creating items

Synopsis:

- `ITEM NAME LABEL`
- where ITEM can be `process`, `entity`, `store`, `channel` or `none`,
- and NAME shall be sort, without whitespaces.

Example:

```data-flow-diagram img/items.svg
# create a process bubble:
process	P	A process

# create a control bubble:
control K  	A control

# create a terminal rectangle:
entity	T	An entity

# create a store:
store	S	A store

# create a channel
channel	C	A channel

# create a point
none	N	A point

```

![Creating items](./img/items.svg)

- A process is a functional unit that processes inputs and generates outputs.

- An entity is an external actor, outside the scope of the model.

- A store holds data.

- A channel is altering significantly the course of flows, in data or
  timely manner. APIs are channels.

- A point is any item that is e.g. repeated from an upper level.

### 2. Creating connections between items

Synopsis:

- `CONNECTION FROM_NAME TO_NAME LABEL`
- where CONNECTION can be `flow`, 'cflow', `bflow` or `signal`.
- Items of type `control` can only be linked by `signal` connections.

Example:

```data-flow-diagram img/connections.svg
process	A1
process	A2
process	B1
process	B2
process	C1
process	C2
process	D1
process	D2
process	E1
process	E2
process X
process Y

# create a directed flow:
flow	A1	A2	a flow

# create a continuous flow:
cflow	B1	B2	a continuous flow

# create a bi-directional flow:
bflow	C1	C2	a bi-directional flow

# create a directed signal:
signal	D1	D2	a signal

# create an undirected flow:
uflow	E1	E2	an undirected flow

# create untargetted connections
flow	*	X	an unsourced flow
signal	Y	*	an untargetted signal
```

![Creating connections](./img/connections.svg)

That's it! With items and connections, you can create any DFD diagram of
arbitrary complexity.

### 3. Syntactic sugars

Syntactic sugars make source easier on the eye:

| Statement with keyword | Equivalent with syntactic sugar    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `flow   A B`           | `A --> B` <br/> or <br/>` B <-- A` |
| `cflow  A B`           | `A ->> B` <br/> or <br/> `B <<- A` |
| `bflow  A B`           | `A <-> B` <br/> or <br/> `B <-> A` |
| `uflow  A B`           | `A --- B` <br/> or <br/> `B --- A` |
| `signal A B`           | `A ::> B` <br/> or <br/> `B <:: A` |

The shaft of the arrow can be of arbitrary lengh, so `->` , `-->` and `------->`
are equivalent.

```data-flow-diagram img/connections-sugar.svg
process	P1
process	P2

P1 --> P2	a flow
P1 <-> P2	a bi-directional flow
P1 ::> P2	a signal
P1 <<- P2       a continuous back flow

*  --> P2	an unsourced flow
P1 ::> *	an untargetted signal
```

![Connection sugars](./img/connections-sugar.svg)

### 4. Optional label

The LABEL can be ommitted, in which case:

- for items, the NAME is used as LABEL,
- for connections, no LABEL is rendered:

```data-flow-diagram img/items-unlabelled.svg
# create a process bubble:
process	Process

# create a terminal rectangle:
entity	Entity

# create a store:
store	Store

# create a channel
channel	Channel

# create a point
none	Point

# connection
Process --> Channel
```

![Unlabelled items](./img/items-unlabelled.svg)

### 5. Styling

#### a. Per-diagram

The keyword `style` defines rendering parameters for the whole
diagram:

| Style statement                 | Effect                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `style context`                 | Makes the diagram a context diagram.                         |
| `style horizontal`              | Layouts flows in the horizontal direction (the default).     |
| `style vertical`                | Layouts flows in the vertical direction.                     |
| `style item-text-width N`       | Sets the items labels wrapping to use N chars columns.       |
| `style connection-text-width N` | Sets the connections labels wrapping to use N chars columns. |
| `style rotated`                 | Rotates the diagram by 90°.                                  |
| `style unrotated`               | Reverts the diagram rotation, if any.                        |

A style apply to the whole diagram, whatever where it is declared in
the source. If a style is re-defined, the last declaration applies.

#### b. Per-item or per-connection

Styling can be applied to a specific item or connection by prefixing
the label by Graphviz attributes in the form.

```
process NAME    [ATTRIBUTES ...] LABEL

ITEM1 --> ITEM2 [ATTRIBUTES ...] LABEL
```

#### Examples

See examples below.

### 6. Frames

Synopsis:

- `frame ITEM ITEM... [= [ATTRIBUTES ...] LABEL]`

Basic frame:

```data-flow-diagram img/frame.svg
process	P1
process	P2
process P3

frame P1 P2 = A frame

P1 --> P3
P3 --> P2
```

![Frames](./img/frame.svg)

Frame without label:

```data-flow-diagram img/frame-without-label.svg
process	P1
process	P2
process P3

frame P1 P2

P1 --> P3
P3 --> P2
```

![Frames without label](./img/frame-without-label.svg)

Frame with styling:

```data-flow-diagram img/frame-blue.svg
process	P1
process	P2
process P3

frame P1 P2 = [style=solid color=blue fontcolor=blue] A blue\nsolid frame

P1 --> P3
P3 --> P2
```

![Blue frame](./img/frame-blue.svg)

## C. Details with examples

### 1. A simple complete example

```data-flow-diagram img/complete-example.svg
process	Acquire	Acquire data
process	Compute
control Control
entity	Device
store	Config	Configuration
channel	API

*	::>  Control	clock
Control <::  *		enable
Control <::  *		disable
Control ::>? Acquire	sampling

Device	->>  Acquire 	continuous raw data
Acquire	-->  Compute	raw records
Config	<->  Compute	parameters

Compute --> API  	records
```

![Complete example](./img/complete-example.svg)

### 2. Items rendered only if used (hidable)

By default, all items are rendered, even if not connected to anything:

```data-flow-diagram img/show-all-items.svg
process	P1	Process 1
process	P2	Process 2
process	P3	Process 3

P1 --> P2	connection
```

![Show all items](./img/show-all-items.svg)

A `?` postfix to an item name indicates that, if unused (i.e. not connected to
anything), the item shall be hidden.

Here, _Process 3_ is not rendered:

```data-flow-diagram img/hide-if-unused.svg
process	P1	Process 1
process	P2?	Process 2
process	P3?	Process 3

P1 --> P2	connection
```

![Hide if unused](./img/hide-if-unused.svg)

### 3. Context diagrams

A top-level, so-called "Context Diagram" can be created by specifying `style context`:

```data-flow-diagram img/context.svg
style context

process	P	The System
entity  E1  Entity 1
entity  E2  Entity 2
entity  E3  Entity 3
entity  E4  Entity 4

E1  --> P   flow
E2  <-- P   flow
E3  <-> P   flow
E4  ::> P   signal
```

![Context diagram](./img/context.svg)

Note that there should be exactly one process.

### 4. Diagram direction

By default, the graph direction is horizontal, so `style horizontal` is implied:

```data-flow-diagram img/horizontal.svg
style horizontal

process	P1
process P2

P1 --> P2
```

![Horizontal](./img/horizontal.svg)

For a top-down direction, use `style vertical`:

```data-flow-diagram img/vertical.svg
style vertical

process	P1
process P2

P1 --> P2
```

![Vertical](./img/vertical.svg)

### 5. Relaxed constraints

By default, the placement of items is constrained by both their
declaration order, and also attempt to minimize connection lengths. In
the following diagram, P2 is slightly shifted to shorten `P1 --> P3`:

```data-flow-diagram img/constraint.svg
style vertical

process	P1
process P2
process P3

P1 -->  P2
P2 -->  P3
P1 -->  P3
```

![Constraint](./img/constraint.svg)

Sometimes, especially in complex diagrams, adding a connection can bring
a constraint that is not desired. It is possible turn off the constraint posed
by any given connection, by appending a `?` to the connection:

```data-flow-diagram img/constraint-relaxed.svg
style vertical

process	P1
process P2
process P3

P1 -->  P2
P2 -->  P3
P1 -->? P3
# equivalent to: flow? P1 P3
```

![Relaxed constraint](./img/constraint-relaxed.svg)

- You can see that `P1 --> P3` did not lead `P2` to be shifted. This
  way, the P1 -> P2 -> P3 alignment reflects a more natural flow.

### 6. Items and connections attributes

#### a. Inline attributes

Rendering attributes can be added by prefixing the label by
`[NAME=VALUE ...]` using Graphviz attributes syntax:

```data-flow-diagram img/attributes.svg
style vertical

process	P1  [fillcolor=red] Red bg
process P2  [color=red fontcolor=blue] Red border, blue text
process P3  [fontcolor=white fillcolor=blue color=blue] Inverted blue

P1 -->  P2  [color=red fontcolor=red] red
P2 -->  P3  [color=blue] blue arrow
P1 -->  P3  [penwidth=2] thick
```

![Attributes](./img/attributes.svg)

For possible attributes, see:

- https://graphviz.org/docs/edges/
- https://graphviz.org/docs/nodes/

Currently, attributes do not apply to `store` nor `channel`.

#### b. Attribute aliases

The `attrib ALIAS attributes...` statement allows to define aliases for
arbitrary attributes.

Using aliases makes subsequent declarations shorter and helps avoid duplication
of attributes.

Choosing alias names having functional or stylistic meanings adds clarity to the
source text.

Multiple aliases can be used for an item. Aliases can be
mixed with inline attributes.

```data-flow-diagram img/attributes-alias.svg
style vertical

# stylistic aliases

attrib GREEN    color=green fontcolor=green

# functional aliases for nodes

attrib START    penwidth=2 fillcolor=lightgrey
attrib ABNORMAL fillcolor=red fontcolor=white color=invis
attrib END      penwidth=2 fillcolor=lightgrey color=grey

# functional aliases for connections

attrib ALERT    color=red fontcolor=red
attrib OK       color=green fontcolor=green
attrib FIXUP    color=blue fontcolor=blue

# graph

control P0  [START] Start
process	P1  System check
process P2  [ABNORMAL] Malfunction state

# using multiple aliases:
process P3  [END GREEN] Done

P0 ::>  P1  trigger
P1 -->  P2  [ALERT] issue found
P2 -->  P1  [FIXUP] issue fixed

# using an alias and an inline attribute:
P1 -->  P3  [OK penwidth=2] all OK
```

![Attributes alias](./img/attributes-alias.svg)

### 7. Text wrapping and line breaks

Newlines can be inserted in any label by means of `\n`.

Lines are wrapped by default by:

- 20 columns for items, and
- 14 columns for connections:

```
data-flow-diagram img/wrapping-1.svg
style vertical

process	P1  Do this and this and also this
process P2  Do\n that and that and also that

P1 -->  P2  result of doing all this
P2 -->  P1  result\nof doing all that
```

![Wrapping-1](./img/wrapping-1.svg)

The column widths can be changed by

- `style item-text-width N` and
- `style connection-text-width N` respectively.

Bigger number of columns:

```data-flow-diagram img/wrapping-2.svg
#include #img/wrapping-1
style item-text-width 40
style connection-text-width 40
```

![Wrapping-2](./img/wrapping-2.svg)

Smaller number of columns:

```data-flow-diagram img/wrapping-3.svg
#include #img/wrapping-1
style item-text-width 8
style connection-text-width 6
```

![Wrapping-2](./img/wrapping-3.svg)

### 8. Real-time aspects (SA/RT)

Two elements are provided for real-time aspects, `signal` and `control`.

1. The `signal` represents an event, conveying short and timely
   information.

2. The `control` receives and emits signals, exclusively. It
   represents a logic (combinatory or sequential) to emit signals on
   the basis of received ones.

`signal` connections can be linked to any type of item. On the other
hand, `control` items cannot receive or emit data flows.

Eventually, `signal` connections are here to drive some `process`
items, and `control` items represent any kind of logic involving
events.

The following example models a lamp that can be switched on by a
push-button, and will automatically turn off after a timeout:

```data-flow-diagram img/realtime.svg
entity	Clock
entity	Button
entity	Lamp
entity	Power Power supply
control	Timer
process	Driver

Driver  <:: Button	switch on
Timer   <:: Button	reset

Timer	::> Driver	switch off
Clock	::> Timer	tick

Driver	--> Lamp	voltage
Power	->> Driver	voltage
```

![Real-time](./img/realtime.svg)

- The timer has an internal hidden state, e.g. a counter.
- While the lamp is on, one can re-trigger the timeout by a push.
- The electrical voltage is here represented by flows.

## D. Markdown snippets

With the command line option `--markdown` (e.g.
`data-flow-diagram README.md --markdown`)
you can embed code blocks that are recognized as Data Flow Diagram snippets.
For each snippet, an image file is generated.

A snippet can be defined by such a code block:

    ```data-flow-diagram img/FILENAME.svg

    DFD_STATEMENTS

    ```

The opening fence ` ```data-flow-diagram img/FILENAME.svg ` must specify
`data-flow-diagram` as formatter, followed by an output file name with
extension.

Some markdown viewers have issues with non-standard formatters on the opening
fence, so an arbitrary number of whitespaces can be inserted between the
opening ` ``` ` and the `data-flow-diagram` formatter, like:

    ```
    data-flow-diagram img/FILENAME.svg

    DFD_STATEMENTS

    ```

Note that only code blocks delimited by triple-backticks fences are considered.
Code blocks defined by quadruple-spaces indentation are ignored:

        data-flow-diagram img/FILENAME.svg

        DFD_STATEMENTS

        indented code blocks are not captured.

A generated image file can be used by e.g. `![Label](img/FILENAME.svg)`.

The source file of the present page is using the markdown feature.

## E. Including

Including allows you to reuse a DFD portion (the includee) into another DFD
(the includer).

The includer does it like this:

    #include FILENAME

where `FILENAME` is the path of the includee, which contains DFD statements.

In the markdown case, includee snippets can be defined as follows:

    ```data-flow-diagram NAME
    DFD_STATEMENTS
    ```

and the includer:

    #include #NAME

Nested inclusions are supported, except if they generate an endless loop (recursion).

Read on for more details.

### 1. Including files

You can include a file as includee.

Say you have a file named `dfd/includee.part` containing:

```
process	P1	Process 1
process	P2	Process 2
```

In any other DFD, you can include the file `dfd/includee.part` by
`#include dfd/includee.part`:

```data-flow-diagram dfd/includer.svg
#include dfd/includee.part

P1 --> P2	connection
```

It is equivalent to having:

```
process	P1	Process 1
process	P2	Process 2

P1 --> P2	connection
```

![Includer](./dfd/includer.svg)

### 2. Including snippet

When using `--markdown`, you can include another snippet of the same document.

#### a. Includee

Here, you first define and generate the snippet `dfd/includee-snippet-1.svg`.

    ```data-flow-diagram dfd/includee-snippet-1.svg
    process	P3	Process 3
    process	P4	Process 4
    ```

The includee generated image can be used: `![Includee snippet](./dfd/includee-snippet-1.svg)`

![Includee snippet](./dfd/includee-snippet-1.svg)

#### b. Includer

Then, we use the snippet `dfd/includee-snippet-1.svg` (defined above) by
`#include #dfd/includee-snippet-1`. The leading `#` mandates to include a
snippet and not a file. Think of it like an anchor to the markdown snippet.
The output format extension (here `.svg` for
`dfd/includee-snippet-1`) must be ommitted.

    ```data-flow-diagram dfd/includer-1.svg

    #include #dfd/includee-snippet-1

    P3 --> P4	connection
    ```

![Includer 1](./img/includer-1.svg)

### 3. Including snippet without generating an image for the includee

Like above, but without generating an image for the includee snippet.

#### a. Includee

Here we first define the snippet `dfd/includee-snippet-2`. A leading `#`
mandates to not generate an image for it. Hence it needs no format extension.

    ```data-flow-diagram #dfd/includee-snippet-2
    process	P5	Process 5
    process	P6	Process 6
    ```

#### b. Includer

The includer works exactly like in the previous section.

    ```data-flow-diagram dfd/includer-2.svg

    #include #dfd/includee-snippet-2

    P5 --> P6	connection
    ```

![Includer 2](./dfd/includer-2.svg)

### 4. Nested includes

The following markdown defines nested snippets:

    ```data-flow-diagram #snippet-1
    process	P1
    process	P2
    ```

    ```data-flow-diagram #snippet-2
    #include #snippet-1
    process	P3
    ```

    ```data-flow-diagram dfd/nested-include.svg
    #include #snippet-2
    P1 --> P3	connection
    P2 --> P3	connection
    ```

This yields the image: <br/>
![Nested include](./img/nested-include.svg)

Such a snippet (which includes itself) involves an infinite recursion:

    ```data-flow-diagram img/snippet-recursive.svg
    process	P1
    #include #snippet-recursive
    ```

and would cause this error during image generation:

```
ERROR: (most recent first)
  line 2: #include #snippet-recursive
  line 1: <snippet #snippet-recursive>
  line 2: #include #snippet-recursive
  line 329: <file:README.md><snippet:img/snippet-recursive.svg>
Error: Recursive include of "#snippet-recursive"
```

## F. Dependencies

It as a good practice to split a functional diagram in many sub-diagrams
(nested or not), each one of low to medium complexity.

The benefit of better readability comes with a drawback for the writer:
maintaining consistancy. To ease this, the "dependencies" feature comes to help.

You can re-declare items already declared in other graphs. This has the following effects:

1. The item is rendered "ghosted",
2. Inter-dependencies are checked, and result in errors if a reference is not found,
   or of wrong type.

Synopsis:

- `ITEM GRAPH:[NAME]  [LABEL]`
- where `GRAPH` can be `#SNIPPET_NAME` or `FILENAME.EXT`

Examples:

- `none    #MyGraph1:`
- `process #MyGraph1:MyItem`
- `process #MyGraph1:MyItem My item`
- `none    MyGraph2.dfd:`
- `process MyGraph2.dfd:MyItem`
- `process MyGraph2.dfd:MyItem My item`

### 1. Using dependencies

#### a. Referring to another snippet

Supposing you have this (referred) snippet:

```
data-flow-diagram dfd/Feature-1.svg
process	This    Do this
```

![Feature-1](./dfd/Feature-1.svg)

In another graph (the referrer), you can refer to the **whole referred graph** by a `none` item:

```data-flow-diagram img/Referrer-1.svg
# Externals:
none #dfd/Feature-1:

# Internals:
process	That    Do that

dfd/Feature-1 --> That
```

![Referrer 1](./img/Referrer-1.svg)

- `#dfd/Feature-1` refers to the `dfd/Feature-1` snippet,
- `:` without an item name, refers to the whole referred graph.
- The referred graph must be used by its graph name, without the
  `#` snippet prefix; here `dfd/Feature-1`.

You can also refer to **items inside the referred graph**, by declaring a referrer of
the same type, and specifying the referred item name:

```data-flow-diagram img/Referrer-2.svg
# Externals:
process #dfd/Feature-1:This

# Internals:
process	That    Do that

This --> That
```

![Referrer 2](./img/Referrer-2.svg)

- `#dfd/Feature-1` refers to the `dfd/Feature-1` snippet.
- `:This` refers to the item named `This` in the referred snippet.
- `process` must be used, in order to be of the same type as the referred item.
- The referred item must be used by its item name; here `This`.
- Since the label is omitted, the name is use instead.

If the referred item has a label that the referrer wants to use, the referrer
must re-declare the label:

```data-flow-diagram img/Referrer-3.svg
# Externals:
process #dfd/Feature-1:This Do this

# Internals:
process	That    Do that

This --> That
```

![Referrer 3](./img/Referrer-3.svg)

#### b. Referring to another DFD file

All the latter can be done with referred graph as separate **file**, instead of snippet.

In such case, the file name of the referred graph shall be used.

Supposing you have a file named `dfd/Feature-2.dfd`, and containing:

```
process These	Do these
```

You can refer to the above graph as follows:

```data-flow-diagram img/dependant-4.svg
# Externals:
none    dfd/Feature-2.dfd:
process dfd/Feature-2.dfd:These

# Internals:
process	That    Do that

dfd/Feature-2   --> That
That        --> These
```

![Dependant 4](./img/dependant-4.svg)

- `dfd/Feature-2.dfd` refers to the `dfd/Feature-2.dfd` file.
- The `dfd/Feature-2` name (without `.dfd` extension) must be further used.
- The same other rules (e.g. accessing items of the referred graph) apply as
  with snippets.

### 2. Checking the dependencies

Dependencies checking lead to error, if any of the following is found:

- The referred graph (snippet or file) does not exist (or is not readable).
- When referring to a whole graph, the referrer is not of type `none`.
- When referring to an item of a graph,
  - the referred item does not exist,
  - the referrer and referred items are not of the same type.

To turn off the checking, specify the `--no-check-dependencies` flag to the
command line.
